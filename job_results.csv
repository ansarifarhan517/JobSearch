We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.
We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.
We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.
You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.
You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.
We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!

What does Sitemate do, exactly?

Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.
Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.
Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format.
